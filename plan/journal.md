# Project journal for PyPortal

## Sunday 23 February 2020

I'm getting the PyPortal ready for Tuesday's Raspberry Pint session.

Sadly, the Adafruit slideshow code I found does not work with the PyPortal.

When I tried to run a simple example using WiFi I hit problems. The Version 4 libraries seem to have socket bugs.

I've now upgraded to `adafruit-circuitpython-pyportal-en_US-5.0.0-beta.5.uf2` and `adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-5.x-mpy-20200222`
and things seem OK.

So:
1. Get the PyPortal to display
    1. the welcome bitmap
    1. a custom bitmap
    1. A list of bitmaps

Next:
1. Create a set of 320x240 .bmps showing Adafruit CircuitPython boards.

I've also tidied up the code.
